THERAPIST: Good afternoon, Sarah. How have you been since our last session?

CLIENT: Hi, Dr. Johnson. It's been a mixed week, honestly. I had some good days, but I also had a couple of rough nights where I couldn't sleep because of the anxiety.

THERAPIST: I'm sorry to hear about the difficult nights. Can you tell me more about what was happening during those times? What thoughts were going through your mind?

CLIENT: It's mostly work stuff. I have this big presentation coming up next week, and I keep imagining all the ways it could go wrong. Like, what if I forget everything? What if people think I'm incompetent? I've been at this job for two years now, but I still feel like an imposter sometimes.

THERAPIST: That sounds like imposter syndrome, which is very common, especially among high achievers. You mentioned you've been at your job for two years - what feedback have you received about your performance?

CLIENT: I mean, my reviews have been good. My manager even mentioned I might be up for a promotion. But I keep thinking they just haven't figured out yet that I don't really know what I'm doing.

THERAPIST: So there's a disconnect between the external evidence - positive reviews, potential promotion - and your internal narrative that you're not competent. Does that resonate?

CLIENT: Yes, exactly. It's like I can't trust the good feedback. I always think people are just being nice or they haven't seen the "real" me yet.

THERAPIST: Let's explore that a bit. When did you first start feeling this way about yourself?

CLIENT: I think... maybe in college? I was the first person in my family to go to university, and I always felt like everyone else belonged there more than I did. Like they had some secret knowledge about how to succeed that I didn't have.

THERAPIST: Being a first-generation college student can come with unique pressures. You were navigating a new environment without the family experience to draw from. That takes a lot of courage and resilience.

CLIENT: I never thought of it that way. I always just focused on how behind I felt.

THERAPIST: That's a pattern we can work on - reframing your narrative. Instead of "I'm behind," we could explore "I'm pioneering a new path for my family." How does that feel?

CLIENT: It feels... different. Kind of empowering, actually. But it's hard to believe it.

THERAPIST: That's completely normal. These thought patterns have been with you for years. Changing them takes time and practice. Let's talk about some concrete strategies for the upcoming presentation. What's worked for you in the past when you've had to do something anxiety-provoking?

CLIENT: Well, I do better when I practice a lot. And sometimes I do this breathing thing before I start - like taking deep breaths.

THERAPIST: Those are excellent strategies. The breathing technique you're describing sounds like diaphragmatic breathing, which activates your parasympathetic nervous system and helps calm the anxiety response. Would you like to practice that together?

CLIENT: Yes, I think that would help.

THERAPIST: Great. Let's do a quick exercise. Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. We're going to breathe in slowly through the nose for four counts, hold for four, and exhale through the mouth for six. The hand on your belly should rise more than the one on your chest.

[They practice breathing together for several minutes]

CLIENT: That does help. I feel a little calmer already.

THERAPIST: Good. I'd like you to practice this for five minutes each morning this week, and also right before your presentation. Now, let's also talk about challenging those negative thoughts. When you think "I'm going to forget everything," what evidence do you have for and against that thought?

CLIENT: Well... I've never actually completely blanked during a presentation before. I've stumbled a few times, but I've always recovered.

THERAPIST: That's important evidence. So your track record shows you can handle presentations, even imperfectly. What might be a more balanced thought to replace "I'm going to forget everything"?

CLIENT: Maybe something like... "I might stumble, but I can recover, and I know my material"?

THERAPIST: That's excellent. It's realistic - it acknowledges the possibility of imperfection while also affirming your ability to cope. I'd like you to write that down and read it to yourself before the presentation.

CLIENT: I can do that.

THERAPIST: How are things going otherwise? Last session you mentioned some tension with your mother.

CLIENT: Oh, that's actually been a bit better. I tried what you suggested - setting a small boundary about phone calls. I told her I can't always answer when I'm at work, and she actually took it okay.

THERAPIST: That's wonderful progress, Sarah. How did it feel to set that boundary?

CLIENT: Scary at first. I was worried she'd be hurt or angry. But when she just said "okay," I felt this huge relief. Like maybe I can ask for what I need without everything falling apart.

THERAPIST: That's a significant insight. You're learning that setting boundaries doesn't have to lead to catastrophe. This connects to what we talked about earlier - your tendency to anticipate the worst. What actually happened was much better than what you feared.

CLIENT: You're right. I do that a lot - expect the worst and then feel surprised when it doesn't happen.

THERAPIST: Recognizing that pattern is the first step to changing it. For homework this week, I'd like you to keep a brief log. When you notice yourself catastrophizing, write down the feared outcome and then later, write what actually happened. We can review it together next session.

CLIENT: That sounds manageable. I'll try it.

THERAPIST: Perfect. Let's also continue with the breathing exercises and the balanced thought we created for the presentation. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?

CLIENT: I don't think so. I actually feel better than when I came in. Thank you.

THERAPIST: You're doing great work, Sarah. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have difficult days. I'll see you next week - same time?

CLIENT: Yes, that works. Thanks, Dr. Johnson.

THERAPIST: Take care, Sarah.
