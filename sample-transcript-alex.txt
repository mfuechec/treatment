DR. CHEN: Good afternoon, Alex. How are you feeling today?

ALEX: Hi Dr. Chen. I'm... okay, I think. It's been a mixed week honestly.

DR. CHEN: Tell me more about that. What made it mixed?

ALEX: Well, I actually did something I've been putting off for months. I finally had that conversation with my manager about my workload. The one we've been talking about.

DR. CHEN: That's a significant step. How did it go?

ALEX: Better than I expected, actually. She was pretty understanding. Said she didn't realize how much had piled up on me. We're going to redistribute some projects next quarter.

DR. CHEN: How did it feel to advocate for yourself like that?

ALEX: Terrifying at first. I almost canceled the meeting three times. But afterward... I felt lighter? Like I'd been carrying this weight and didn't even know it.

DR. CHEN: That's a powerful observation. You've mentioned before feeling like you couldn't speak up at work. What do you think helped you push through the fear this time?

ALEX: I think... the breathing exercises actually helped. When I felt the panic coming on before the meeting, I did the 4-7-8 breathing we practiced. It didn't make the anxiety disappear, but it made it manageable enough that I could still walk into her office.

DR. CHEN: I'm glad that technique is working for you. You mentioned it was a mixed week though. What was the harder part?

ALEX: [sighs] My dad called on Tuesday. First time in two months.

DR. CHEN: How was that conversation?

ALEX: Short. Awkward. He asked about work, I gave one-word answers, then we ran out of things to say. The whole call was maybe four minutes.

DR. CHEN: What feelings came up during and after that call?

ALEX: During it, I just felt... numb, I guess. Like I was on autopilot. But afterward, I was angry. Really angry. Like, why does he even bother calling if he's not going to actually try to connect?

DR. CHEN: That anger sounds like it's protecting something underneath. What do you think is beneath the anger?

ALEX: [long pause] Hurt, probably. Disappointment. I keep hoping he'll be different, and he never is. And I'm mad at myself for still hoping.

DR. CHEN: It's not foolish to hope for connection with a parent, Alex. That's a very human need.

ALEX: I know. Logically I know that. But it feels like I'm setting myself up to be let down over and over.

DR. CHEN: What would it look like to protect yourself while still leaving space for the possibility of connection?

ALEX: I don't know. Maybe... lowering my expectations? Not expecting a real conversation, so if it happens, it's a surprise instead of a disappointment?

DR. CHEN: That's one approach. Another might be thinking about what boundaries would help you feel safer in those interactions.

ALEX: Like what?

DR. CHEN: Well, for example, you could decide that you'll keep calls to a certain length, or that certain topics are off-limits. Or you might choose to only engage when you're in a mental space to handle it, rather than feeling obligated to answer every time he calls.

ALEX: I never thought about not answering as an option. It feels... rude? But also kind of freeing to think about.

DR. CHEN: Setting boundaries isn't rude. It's self-preservation. And it doesn't have to be permanent - you can adjust as things change.

ALEX: Yeah. I think I need to sit with that idea for a while.

DR. CHEN: That's perfectly fine. There's no rush. Speaking of sitting with things - how has your sleep been this week?

ALEX: Better, actually. I've been doing the no-screens-before-bed thing, and I think it's helping. I'm falling asleep faster, and I haven't woken up at 3am as much.

DR. CHEN: That's excellent progress. And the journaling before bed?

ALEX: I've been doing it most nights. It does help get the racing thoughts out of my head. Though sometimes I write for like twenty minutes and realize I'm just rehashing the same worry over and over.

DR. CHEN: When you notice that happening, what do you do?

ALEX: Usually I just... keep going, I guess. I don't know what else to do.

DR. CHEN: One thing you might try is, when you notice you're stuck in a loop, write down one small action you could take about that worry. Even if you don't do it right then, it can help your brain feel like there's a path forward.

ALEX: That makes sense. I'll try that.

DR. CHEN: How are things going with your friend group? Last time you mentioned feeling disconnected from some of your college friends.

ALEX: Oh, that's actually another good thing this week. I reached out to Jamie - we were really close in college but drifted apart. I just sent a simple text asking if they wanted to grab coffee. And they said yes, so we're meeting this weekend.

DR. CHEN: That took courage, reaching out after a period of distance. How did it feel to send that message?

ALEX: Scary. I kept thinking, what if they don't respond? What if things are weird? But I remembered what you said about how connection requires some risk, and I just... hit send before I could overthink it.

DR. CHEN: And the response was positive.

ALEX: Yeah. They seemed genuinely happy to hear from me. Which made me realize maybe I'd built up this story in my head that people didn't want to hear from me, and it wasn't even true.

DR. CHEN: That's a really important insight, Alex. The stories we tell ourselves about what others think often say more about our own fears than about reality.

ALEX: I'm starting to see that. It's just hard to remember in the moment.

DR. CHEN: It takes practice. You're building new neural pathways, and that doesn't happen overnight.

ALEX: [laughs softly] You always say that. Neural pathways.

DR. CHEN: Because it's true! Your brain has been running certain patterns for years. Creating new ones takes repetition and patience.

ALEX: I know. I'm trying to be patient with myself. Some days are easier than others.

DR. CHEN: That's all any of us can do. Before we wrap up, I want to check in about something. Last session you mentioned having some darker thoughts when you were really stressed. How has that been this week?

ALEX: Honestly, not as bad. I had one night where things felt pretty hopeless - Wednesday, after the call with my dad. But I used the coping plan we made. Called my sister, watched a comfort show, reminded myself it would pass. And it did.

DR. CHEN: I'm really glad you used those tools. And that you have your sister as a support.

ALEX: She's been great. She doesn't always know what to say, but she listens. That's enough most of the time.

DR. CHEN: Having people who will simply be present with us is incredibly valuable. Is there anything else you want to make sure we touch on today?

ALEX: I don't think so. I feel like this was a good session. I have some things to think about with the boundary stuff, and I'm looking forward to seeing Jamie this weekend.

DR. CHEN: Those both sound like positive things to carry into the week. For next session, maybe reflect on what boundaries with your father might look like - not necessarily to implement them yet, just to explore the possibilities.

ALEX: I can do that.

DR. CHEN: Great. Same time next week?

ALEX: Yes, that works. Thanks, Dr. Chen.

DR. CHEN: Thank you, Alex. Take care of yourself this week.
